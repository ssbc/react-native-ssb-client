# DEPRECATED

Originally, this library was doing two things: (1) providing shims for ssb libraries to work with react-native, (2) providing a manifest that would be used in the ssb config. These two things are now split out from this library. (1) is `react-native-ssb-shims` and (2) should be done in the application repository (e.g. MMMMM and others).

## install

Install with `npm install`, *not* Yarn.

`npm install --save react-native-ssb-client`

## usage

Same as [`ssb-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssb-client).
